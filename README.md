# Evaluating SPAC as An Asset Class Using Sentiment Analysis and Quantitative Analyses
This project evaluated the risk-return profile of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), after the hype on SPAC in 2021 had passed, and data on performances of SPAC and de-SPACed companies (those that went public through a SPAC scheme) had been more abundantly recorded. 

## Methodology
The project included the following techniques in Python:
- Scraping titles, abstracts, and contents of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles about SPAC using _Selenium_
- Sentiment analysis and visualizing the sentiment distribution of the articles
- Collecting data on performances of de-SPACed companies from Spactrack.io
- Visualizing the return distribution of de-SPACed companies using _diverging color histogram_
- Querying performances of S&P 500, SPCX (SPAC ETF), DSPC (de-SPACed ETF) with _yfinance_ package
- Plotting relative returns of SPY, SPCX, and DSPC to evaluate how a dollar would have performed if put in each of these asset classes

## File Run-down
The repository contains the following files:
### Data:
- final_WSJ_News.xlsx : scraped headlines, subheadings, body contents, timestamps of WSJ articles that mentioned SPAC
- DeSPACed.xlsx
- DeSPACed.csv
(Both contains the same data of companies that went public through SPAC. Data was collected from Spactrack.io)
### Jupyter Notebook files:
- WSJ_Scraping_SPAC.ipynb
  - Scraping titles, abstracts, and contents of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles about SPAC using _Selenium_
  - Reader should be aware that WSJ's website structure might have changed since the project concluded, so that exact codes (especially the XPATHs) might not be working. However, the file might provide a broad methodology for scraping with Selenium and error handling.
  - _Disclaimer: Readers are cautioned against abuse of the scraping program. Note that the author logged in with own account and scraped only after searching for articles containing the keyword to avoid excessive robot visits to the site. WSJ membership allows reading unlimited online articles anyway, so the act of scraping should be considered as the automation for copying and pasting, rather than as a means for accessing data. The author neither has the code for nor condoning unauthorized access to WSJ data.
